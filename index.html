                <p>
                Thank you for visiting our site! We (Stephanie O'Brien and Elizabeth Eastman) are the Safe Lid team and we designed a product
                to keep you safe during a night out of drinking. Our product is a lid that can be attached to any standard solo cup.
                With just the click of a button, the Safe Lid will calculate your BAC for you.
                Log onto our <a href="http://web.mit.edu/eeastman/www/safelid/safecup.html">web app</a> to see your BAC at any time and view the history of your
                drinks. To implement this we used an ultrasonic sensor, the HC-SR04. The sensor emits an
                ultrasound that will bounce off of the liquid in the cup and be received by the echo
                pin. This will give us the distance from our sensor to the drink which will allow us
                to calculate the volume and thus the number of standard drinks and BAC. We used a Particle Photon
                which has a built in wifi module to communicate with the sensor, all powered by a 9 volt battery.
                Here's how it works for the user: pour your drink into your cup and place the lid on top.
                Click the button that corresponds to your drink type and the Safe Lid will perform its calculations.
                Now, enjoy your night and remember to keep a safe BAC level!

                <h3>Prior to Oct. 16</h3>
                <p>Prior to this week, we brainstormed multiple ideas and Safe Cup was one of them.
                Here's our initial drawing: </p>
                <img src="idea1.png" alt="Safe Cup Drawing" style="width:200px;height:300px;">
                <h3>Oct. 16 - 22</h3>
                <p>During this week, we chose our final idea and presented it to the class.
                We have since made changes to our idea (it has transformed from a cup to a lid).
                However, at this time we had the Safe Cup. The idea is to allow users to be safe about
                drinking by providing an effortless means of tracking alcohol comsumption via BAC.</p>

                <p>Here's our HW10 from this week: For our final project, we have selected the Safe Cup.
                  As described in our top 5 ideas, the Safe Cup will measure the number of standard drinks you
                  have had in a given time. The idea is that the amount of liquid that constitutes a drink for wine
                  is different than beer and other alcoholic beverages. We would use density measurements in order to
                  calculate which type of alcoholic beverage is placed into the cup and simple volume measurements to
                  calculate the number of standard drinks based on that beverage. There will be a reset button to reset
                 the drink count that is displayed on the screen on the cup.</p>

                 <p>The project will fulfill the requirements in the following ways. (1) We anticipate to 3D print the actual cup.
                   (2) We plan on using sensors to calculate the number of drinks in the cup as well as a reset button for each
                   time a person begins their night out (3) We will transmit the number of drinks into a web application.
                   This also means that you can keep track of alcohol consumption over the course of a period of time.
                   (4) As a user pours a drink into the cup, we will record the amount of alcohol in that pour and transmit the data.
                   (5) Finally, we are solving a problem of inconsistencies and people being unaware of the amount of alcohol present in drinks.
                   We are making drinking safer for people by creating an easy way for users to monitor their alcohol consumption.</p>

                   <p>The final demo will consist of different types (densities) of alcohol and seeing how the cup measures
                     the number of standard drinks that have been present in the cup. We will bring in the cup and different types of
                     alcohol, if that is okay, to show that our cup accurately measures the number of standard drinks.</p>
                <h3>Oct. 23 - 29</h3>
                <p>We took this week to break off and brainstorm conceptions of our idea. We wanted to explore
                different options for sensing and building out our prototype. In the end, we decided (for now)
                on using a water level sensor for our cup.</p>
                <h3>Oct. 30 - Nov. 5</h3>
                During this week, we built our initial test prototype. We attached a water level sensor
                to a cup and were able to successfully get readings which could be translated
                to BAC with some user input.
                <h3>Nov. 6 - 12</h3>
                <p>This was the week of our midterm project presentations of our first prototype.
                Our plan at this point was to use a water level sensor for measurements. We had prototyped using
                an arudino uno and were able to sense the level of liquid in a cup from which we would be
                be able to calculate volume and thus the number of standard drinks. We were still left with
                making a final decision of the best way to measure the volume of the drink in the cup and
                build out the actual prototype and web application.</p>
                <h3>Nov. 13 - 19</h3>
                <p>We started out this week deciding between using some sort of pressure sensor or the water level
                sensor we used in our first prototype as our main means of detecting the liquid in the cup. However,
                as we researched more, we eliminated the pressure sensor for feasability and exposed cons of using
                the water level sensor. We would only be able to use the water level sensor by attaching it to the top
                of the cup and thus could only sense when the user filled the cup up to a certain level because the
                sensor's length is shorter than that of a cup. We were unsatisfied by this and decided to explore other options.
                We decided to use an ultrasonic sensor that was reliable and would not constrain how much alcohol could be put into the cup
                and be sensed. This meant changing from a cup to a lid as our product.</p>
                <h3>Nov. 20 - 26</h3>
                <p>Thanksgiving break!</p>
                <h3>Nov. 27 - Dec. 3</h3>
                <p>This week we made significant progress with our new idea for our prototype. We were now making the
                Safe Lid using an ultrasonic sensor. Our first big task was to get the electronics working. In the end,
                we were able to get accurate readings using a Particle Photon with wifi capabilities, the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor,
                and simple buttons, all powered by a 9V battery (using a regulator). Once we had the electronics working and therefore knew our size constraints
                for fitting them all in a lid, we were able to design and 3D print the lid that would house our electronics and laser cut a piece to cover it on which the buttons could lie.</p>
                <h3>Dec. 4 - Dec. 10</h3>
                <p>At this point, we had our electronics working with just minimal arduino code in order to test its functionality.
                This week, it was time to build out the arudino code to calculate the number of standard drinks using the input
                from the ultrasonic sensor as well as to build out the web application which a user can visit to view his or her
                information (BAC and profile).</p>
                <h3>Dec. 11 - Dec. 17</h3>
                <p>We used this week to wrap up with our finishing touches. We made our final changes
                to our web app, made this site to showcase our prototype and prepared for our class
                presentation.</p>
